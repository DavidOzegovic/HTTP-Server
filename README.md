# HTTP-Server
This is my first networking project: a basic HTTP server implemented in C.
Throughout this project, I learned the differences between a TCP server and an HTTP server, as well as how IP addresses and ports work. I also gained hands-on experience with how data is transmitted over HTTP and how a server responds to client requests.
Features
Simple HTTP server and client written in C.
Serves an example web page (index.html) displaying "Hello World".
Can be accessed directly from a web browser.

How to Run:
Compile and run tcpServer.c.
Open your web browser and navigate to:
http://127.0.0.1:8080/index.html
You should see a web page displaying "Hello World".
If you open your browser's developer tools and check the Network tab, you will see a 200 OK response status confirming successful communication.

Reflection:
I really enjoyed working on this networking project. While it’s a basic implementation, it gave me a solid foundation in networking concepts and HTTP communication. I plan to continue improving this project to make it more robust and feature-rich.
